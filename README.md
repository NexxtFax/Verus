# Verus
A easy to use Minecraft Wii U mod tool

## Information
My goal with this project was to create a small usefull mod collection in an easy to use tool for Minecraft Wii U Edition.
I first started work on this earlier this year and worked on it for like 5 months. I had long breaks in between so the whole development time was like 1 - 2 weeks. Also most of the mods are present in EZ-Cheatz V2. 
I may update the tool if I feel like it but do not expect any large updates.

## How to Use
Compile this project or just download the pre-compiled version form Releases. After that just run the program and type your Wii U IP Address from TCP-Gecko into the text box. After that you can use the tool.

## How to Compile
You need to use Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 to compile Verus.
